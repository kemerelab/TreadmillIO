# The point of this config file is to light up all 12 of the GPIO LEDs for testing during manufacturing.
# It's a simple statemachine that set's them to high, and then turns one off at a time with a 500 ms delay,
#   until they're all off. Then the cycle repeats.
#
# Since its for testing, this is also a chance to validate that "LogCommands: False" doesn't cause problems.


Preferences:
  HeartBeat: 1000 # The interval at which a heart-beat info message is printed to screen (in ms) 
  RandomSeed: 345
  LogCommands: False


GPIO: # A list of GPIO pins used in the task
  GPIO1: # This is an arbitrary label used later to configure Reward
    Number: 1 # This is the pin number from the board
    Type: 'Output' # Pin type is either 'Input' or 'Output'; special cases could be 'Input_Pulldown' or 'Input_Pullup' or 'Input_Disable' 
                           # (where the pull-down/pull-up resistors are enabled).
    #Power: True # The 'Power' option is for 'Input' type GPIOs. It configures whether the Aux-GPIO is set to high, 
    #            # enabling the power channel of the audio jack.
    Mirror: True # The 'Mirror' option is for 'Output' type GPIOs. It configures whether the associated Aux-GPIO pin is raised/lowered 
                 # whenver the GPIO itself is. The Aux-GPIO is connected to an LED, which allows for visualization of the GPIO state.
