# This example config controls a VR environment in which reward is automatically
# dispensed when the animal passes through a "Reward Zone" (i.e., "classical conditioning"). 
# The VR includes 4 different location specific sound sources as well as a
# background sound. The state machine controls the task - the animal
# is rewarded when they reach the "RewardZone", at which point the
# position is frozen, then reset ("the animal is teleported"), and then
# released for the animal to control again.

Info: # "Info" configuration options can be overridden by command line options
  MouseID: Mouse # Used to name saved data file
  Note: '' # Added in a block at the start of saved data file
  Session: '' # This is added to default (date and time)

GPIO: # A list of GPIO pins used in the task
  Lick: # This is an arbitrary label used later to configure Reward
    Number: 3 # This is the pin number from the board
    Type: 'Input' # Pin type is either 'Input' or 'Output'; special cases could be 'Input_Pulldown' or 'Input_Pullup' 
                           # (where the pull-down/pull-up resistors are enabled).
    Power: True # The 'Power' option is for 'Input' type GPIOs. It configures whether the Aux-GPIO is set to high, 
                # enabling the power channel of the audio jack.
  Reward:
    Number: 5
    Type: 'Output'
    Mirror: True # The 'Mirror' option is for 'Output' type GPIOs. It configures whether the associated Aux-GPIO pin is raised/lowered 
                 # whenver the GPIO itself is. The Aux-GPIO is connected to an LED, which allows for visualization of the GPIO state.
