# This config file is intended to operate the environment for an animal shuttling back and forth
# on a raised linear track with liquid reward at either end. 4 GPIOs are used to sense the
# animal breaking a beam ("Poke1/2") and triggering the reward release ("Reward1/2").

Info: # "Info" configuration options can be overridden by command line options
  MouseID: Mouse # Used to name saved data file
  Note: '' # Added in a block at the start of saved data file
  Session: '' # This is added to default (date and time)
  TaskType: Simple Linear Track

Preferences:
  HeartBeat: 2000 # The interval at which a heart-beat info message is printed to screen (in ms) 
  RandomSeed: 345
  LogCommands: False
  EnableSound: False

GPIO: # A list of GPIO pins used in the task
  Reward1:
    Number: 3 # This is the pin number from the board
    Type: 'Output' # Pin type is either 'Input' or 'Output'; special cases could be 'Input_Pulldown' or 'Input_Pullup' or 'Input_Disable' 
                           # (where the pull-down/pull-up resistors are enabled).
    #Power: True # The 'Power' option is for 'Input' type GPIOs. It configures whether the Aux-GPIO is set to high, 
    #            # enabling the power channel of the audio jack.
    Mirror: True # The 'Mirror' option is for 'Output' type GPIOs. It configures whether the associated Aux-GPIO pin is raised/lowered 
                 # whenver the GPIO itself is. The Aux-GPIO is connected to an LED, which allows for visualization of the GPIO state.
  Reward2:
    Number: 4
    Type: 'Output'
