# Notes:
# - Poke sensors are smoothed by transitioning first to a "Leaving" state,
#   which either returns to the Patch state if the sensor is ON within a 
#   specified timeout period (500 ms), or transitions to the next Interpatch
#   state if the timeout period is exceeded. Rather than determining whether
#   the previous state was "InPatch-Waiting" or "InPatch-Available", it's fine
#   just to return to "InPatch-Waiting", which will simply transition to
#   "InPatch-Available" on the next step if reward is already available.
# - This assumes that all reward volumes are the same, as opposed to varying
#   reward volume based on bucket volume (i.e. max(min(V_current, V_max), V_min)).
#   I prefer fixed volume sizes because then only time between rewards
#   is variable, whereas in the latter case both reward size and time between
#   rewards are variable.
# - We've accounted for the corner case in which multiple licks quickly drain
#   a reservoir with multiple rewards in succession. Note that the syringe
#   pumps require 100 ms to detect logic level changes (two 50 ms samples), and
#   to obtain small rewards (2 uL), they are programmed to pulse on a rising edge.
#   So, each rising and falling edge must be separated by at least 100 ms. The
#   PumpOnDelay state both 1) ensures logic HIGH will be last for at least 100 ms
#   and 2) the reward tone will also last for at least 100 ms. PumpOffDelay
#   ensures that the same for logic LOW. This leads to some slight delays only
#   in the corner case when an animal is quickly emptying rewards from the reservoir.
# - The "hacky" departures from using simplistic, low-level states are:
#   - A more complex "Patch" type state that computes when rewards are available.
#   - A "Reset" value for resetting the patch internal clock.
