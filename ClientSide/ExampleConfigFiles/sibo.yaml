GPIO: # A list of GPIO pins used in the task
  Lick: # This is an arbitrary label used later to configure Reward
    Number: 2 # This is the pin number from the board
    Type: 'Input' # Pin type is either 'Input' or 'Output'; special cases could be 'Input_Pulldown' or 'Input_Pullup' 
                           # (where the pull-down/pull-up resistors are enabled).
    Power: True # The 'Power' option is for 'Input' type GPIOs. It configures whether the Aux-GPIO is set to high, 
                # enabling the power channel of the audio jack.
  Reward:
    Number: 5
    Type: 'Output'
    Mirror: True # The 'Mirror' option is for 'Output' type GPIOs. It configures whether the associated Aux-GPIO pin is raised/lowered 
                 # whenver the GPIO itself is. The Aux-GPIO is connected to an LED, which allows for visualization of the GPIO state.
